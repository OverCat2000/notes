#### big data def:

big data are kind of data set that are too large and complex to be processed in traditional processing applications.
	high volume
	high velocity
	high variety
	fast growing mobile data traffic
	cloud computing traffic
	rapid development of technologies
		AI
		Internet of things (IoT)

#### big data analytics

advanced analytic tool
	predictive analytics
	data mining
extract value from data and generate insight for business


#### Analytics as a service

big data analytics is not difficult for organizations that wish to store and analyze data on premise.
AaaS model is the solution for this, which enable organizations to carry out analytics via clod base subscription service. avoids high costs associated with on site storing and processing

#### consumption

#### major players in big data analytics

oracle
Microsoft
SAP
	advanced predictive analysis software
IBM
Informatica
	analytics data integration and Integrity software

#### big data complexity and collateral security issues

	corporate data
	customer data


#### network perimeter insecurity

zero trust architecture solutions

#### social engineering attacks

gateways are useful for identifying bad links
sandbox

#### Data cleaning problems

automated data cleaning process
	need to be configured correctly


#### <span style="color:#ff0000">flawed data masking measures</span>

data masking polices to distinguish data that identifies the customers from confidential information about them.

a key solutions is data encryption. but it takes time to implement.

data scrambling
	data are randomly reorganized and replaced

data substitution 
	fake data replaces real data

also the data masking algorithms should also be kept secure.


#### fake data generation

through cyber attacks data can be altered so that they end up on users dash board. its a security risk if the organizations cannot identify fake or outdated data in their central repo. 
ML models can be used to find anomalies in data. theses models also reduce fraud detection time.


#### unauthorized changes in meta data

implement user control
obligatory authorization process for employees
metadata sanitization 
	author, corrections done on document, history

#### employees' carelessness

implementing multi-layer authentication
threat detections approach


### major concerns with Big data

complexity of data in terms of 
	structure
	source
	storage location
	format
	device type
	
storing
cleaning
masking

controlling data transformations


#### privacy challenges of big data

ensuring security and confidentiality of business data and customers sensitive data are the main concern
	improve system's cyber attack resiliency
	configure automated data cleaning 
	data masking
	document sanitization
	establish mandatory authorization for employees
	continuous monitoring of the system


### challenge of big data

Storage
	challenge to store in legacy systems
	unstructured data cannot be stored in traditional databases

processing
	reading
	transforming
	extracting
	formatting

security
	data is non-encrypted
	strict security protocols for access rights

#### finding and fixing data quality issues

correct information in the original database
